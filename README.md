# Libft
**Libft** is the first project of cadet's 42. You have to use the **C** language to reproduce functions from **Libc** and create additional functions that will be used in the next project.

## Part 1 - Libc functions
Reproduce a set of functions from the Libc. Functions will have the same prototypes and implementation as the originals. All functions are defined in **man**

## Part 2 - Additional functions
Develop a set of functions related to trimming and joining strings and functions that display output to the Terminal.

## Part Bonus
Create the functions that work like a linked list.
